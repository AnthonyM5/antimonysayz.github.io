There are many reasons for deciding to start understanding programming and development, including first and foremost  the fact that it software/web development is considered a rapidly developing industry.  As demonstrated by the plethora of "Learn to Code" initiatives online, the aura around programming and STEM fields in general seem to be the career path of the future.  There is an idea that the country does not have a lack of engineering jobs, but rather a lack of capable engineers to fill the expanding field.  Another less tangible reason to learn to code is embracing a challenge that requires logic, reasoning, and a lot of patience that can only translate into your regular life as well.  For the two aforementioned reasons, and a childhood revolved around the computer, I decided to research a little more about programming courses.  

I hope to be able to gain a useful, career transitioning skillset that can facilitate a more spiritually (and financially) rewarding career, but also acknowledge that embracing this challenge can only help to foster continued learning.  My intention is to be able to use what I will be learning to view the world differently and get a more in-depth insight on websites and how they are structured.  So far, it has been an exciting journey and it promises to be one of the most exciting things I have discovered.
